As opposed to robotic arms, humanoid robots are mobile and therefore contact points with the
environments should be accounted for when computing their dynamics.

Here, we derive a way to compute the required torque on a humanoid robot standing on either one
or two legs to sustain the gravity.

# Introduction

The general equation of motion is:

$$
M(q) \dot v + g(q) + h(q, v) = \tau \space \space (1)
$$

Where:

* $$q$$ is the configuration of the robot joints,
* $$v$$ is the speeds of the robot joints (and $$\dot v$$) acceleration of robot joints,
* $$M(q)$$ is the mass matrix,
* $$h(q, v)$$ are Coriolis and centripetal effects,
* $$g(q)$$ is the generalized gravity,
* $$\tau$$ are the degrees of freedom torque.

If we want no acceleration $$\dot v = 0$$, and we ignore other non linear effects ($$h$$):

$$\tau = g(q)$$

Thus, for any "static" robot like a robotic arm anchored to the ground, we can simply stop here.
The generalized gravity is indeed directly the torques we need to compensate gravity.

# Floating base

Now, what if we have a mobile robot, like a humanoid? The thing is that we need to represent the fact
that the robot is moving in the world. This is typically achieved by adding a *floating base*.

The *floating base* is a set of 6 extra degrees of freedom added at the beginning of the kinematics
chain representing the position of the robot in the world.

As an illustration, imagine an humanoid robot attached to an invisible robotic arm itself anchored to
the ground. (This is just a mental visualization; the floating base is of course not constrained to
the singluarities and the workspace of a robotic arm).

The equation $$(1)$$ now becomes:

$$
M(q) \dot v + g(q) + h(q, v) =
\begin{bmatrix}
0_6 \\
\tau
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Where $$0_6$$ is the dimension-$$6$$ vector of null torques in the floating base. Subject to gravity, the only way
to balance this equation is to include some acceleration on the floating base: the robot is "falling" and there is no
way to prevent that because our current model doesn't includes contact forces.

# Contact forces

Contact forces act on the robot through the transpose of the Jacobian of contact frame. For more information
see [Modern Robotics, chapter 5.2](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/images/7/7f/MR.pdf).

Those additional terms can be added to equation $$(1)$$, which is now:

$$
M(q) \dot v + g(q) + h(q, v) =
\begin{bmatrix}
0_6 \\
\tau
\end{bmatrix}
+
\underbrace{
\sum_i
J_i^T f_i
}_{contact forces}

\space \space (2)
$$

Again, supposing we want no acceleration and neglecting other non linear effects than gravity, our equation
becomes:

$$
g(q)
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0_6 \\
\tau
\end{bmatrix}
+
\sum_i
J_i^T f_i
\space \space (3)
$$

# One support leg

With one support leg, equation $$(3)$$ now is:

$$
g(q)
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0_6 \\
\tau
\end{bmatrix}
+
J_l^T f_l
$$

Where $$J_l$$ is the Jacobian of the left foot and $$f_l$$ the wrench (a 6D vector packaging the forces and the
moments) applied on the left foot.

We can split this equation in two parts:

$$
\begin{cases}
g_u(q) = (J_l^T)_u f_l
\\
g_a(q) = \tau + (J_l^T)_a f_l
\end{cases}
$$

Here, the underscript $$u$$ and $$a$$ denotes respectively the unactuated and actuated parts of the gravity
and Jacobian.

Since $$(J_l^T)_u$$ is the Jacobian of an universal floating base, it can always be inverted, and:

$$
f_l = (J_l^T)_u^{-1} g_u(q)
$$

Is the only solution of contact forces to balance the equation. We can then substitute them back in the
actuated part of equation and get:

$$
\tau = g_a(q) - (J_l^T)_a f_l
$$

Which are the torques needed on the robot joints.

# Two support legs

We now assume two support legs, and then have:

$$
g(q)
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0_6 \\
\tau
\end{bmatrix}
+
J_l^T f_l
+
J_r^T f_r
$$

With $$J_l$$ and $$J_r$$ being respectively the Jacobian of the left and right foot, and $$f_l$$ and
$$f_r$$ respectively the contact forces on left and right foot.

We can do the same split as previously, but separating also equations for left and right legs:

$$
\begin{cases}
g_u(q) = (J_l^T)_u f_l + (J_r^T)_u f_r \space \space (4)
\\
g_l(q) = \tau_l + (J_l^T)_l f_l + \underbrace{(J_r^T)_l}_0 f_r  \space \space (5)
\\
g_r(q) = \tau_l + \underbrace{(J_l^T)_r}_0 f_l + (J_r^T)_r f_r  \space \space (6)
\end{cases}
$$

Because of the kinematics structure of the robot, we know that $$(J_r^T)_l$$ and $$(J_l^T)_r$$ are null
(because left and right legs are different branches in the kinematics tree).

Here, we can't solve the contact forces using the first equation, because the system is under-constrained.
Indeed, forces are 12 degrees of freedom while we only have 6 equations.

## Minimizing contact forces

We could solve equation $$(4)$$ with:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
f_l \\ f_r
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
(J_l^T)_u &
(J_r^T)_u
\end{bmatrix}^{\dagger}
g_u(q)
$$

Where $$\dagger$$ denotes the [Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%E2%80%93Penrose_inverse).
(*Note: With Numpy, you can use [np.linalg.pinv](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.pinv.html),
and with Eigen you can use [computeOrthogonalDecomposition().solve()](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/classEigen_1_1CompleteOrthogonalDecomposition.html#title32).*)

That would give us the solution that minimizes contact forces (more precisely $$|| f ||^2$$). But if you want to
control an humanoid robot, it is more likely that what you want to minimize is the torques used in motors instead.

## Minimizing torques

We can turn equation $$(4)$$ into a relation between $$f_l$$ and $$f_r$$:

$$
f_l =
\underbrace{
- (J_l^T)_u^{-1} 
(J_r^T)_u 
}_A
f_r

+

\underbrace{
(J_l^T)_u^{-1} 
g_u(q)
}_B
$$


Substituing it in $$(5)$$, we get:

$$
(J_l^T)_l f_l
=
g_l(q) - \tau_l

\\

(J_l^T)_l (A f_r + B)
=
g_l(q) - \tau_l

\\

f_r 
=
\underbrace{
- 
((J_l^T)_l A)^{-1}
}_C
\tau_l 
+
\underbrace{
((J_l^T)_l A)^{-1}
(
g_l(q) - (J_l^T)_l B
) 
}_D 

\space \space (7)
$$

And, from $$(6)$$:

$$

f_r
=
\underbrace{
-
(J_r^T)_r^{-1}
}_E
\tau_l
+
\underbrace{
(J_r^T)_r^{-1}
g_r(q)
}_F

\space \space (8)
$$

Thus, combining $$(7)$$ and $$(8)$$, we can get a relation between $$\tau_l$$ and $$\tau_r$$:

$$
C \tau_l + D = E \tau_r + F 
$$

Which is another under-constrained system expressed in terms of torques. We can now find the solution
minimizing torques:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\tau_l \\
\tau_r
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
C & -E
\end{bmatrix}^{\dagger}
(F-D)
$$

# It is not over

It seems that we now have a solution to the initial problem. However, we forgot a strong assumption: the contact
forces are *unilateral*. This means that we can't "pull" on the ground for example.

The solution to the single support foot equation is unique, thus we can check if it is feasible but there are no
other torques we could apply else. However, the solution with two supports is underconstrained and admits
an infinite set of solutions.

What we want it to explore those solutions, and select the one that minimize torques **subject to** some constraints
on the force (in that case, $$f_z > 0$$, if $$f_z$$ is upward).

To achieve this, we can formulate the problem as a *Quadratic Programming* problem, and give it to a solver that
will find the best solution for us. Such a solver can address problems of the form:

$$
min \space \frac{1}{2} x^T P x + c^T x \\
subjectÂ \space to:  \\
A x = b \\
G x \leq h 
$$

Let's consider the double support problem here. As you will see, this formulation can also be easily extended to
any number of contact forces.

## QP variables

The QP variables that we will use are:

$$
x = \begin{bmatrix} \tau_a & f_l & f_r  \end{bmatrix} ^T
$$

Where $$\tau_a$$ is the robot torques, and where $$f_l$$ and $$f_r$$ the contact forces.

## Score function

To define our score function, we will choose $$c$$ to be 0, and $$P$$ to be a diagonal matrix, with $$1$$ on the
diagonal for values that correspond to an actuated torque, and $$\epsilon$$ for unactuated torques and contact forces.

If you think about it, with this $$P$$, the resulting score will be the sum of the (squared) torques, plus
the sum of the (squared) forces times $$\epsilon$$. This means that the main priority is to find the solution
with the minimum torques, and the second (with a very small weight) priority to minimize the forces.

This trick is required since the forces are part of our optimization variables dans the *QP solver* needs a score
to be minimized for all those variables.

## Equality constraint

The equality constraint is the one we've been dealing with the whole time:

$$
\underbrace{
\begin{bmatrix}
S & J_l^T & J_r^T
\end{bmatrix}
}_A
\begin{bmatrix}
\tau \\
f_l \\
f_r 
\end{bmatrix}
=
\underbrace{
g
}_b
$$

Here, $$S$$ is a *selection matrix*, that is basically the identity with zeroes for the unactuated torques.

## Inequality constraint

The problem we formulated so far is already useable with QP, and does exactly the same as what was explained in detail
in the previous section, but in a cleanier way.

We can now take advantage of the QP real advantage: the inequality constraint, to ensure that our contacts are
unilateral:

$$
f_{l_z} \geq 0 \\
f_{r_z} \geq 0
$$

Those constraints can be set by adding two rows in $$G$$ and $$h$$.

$$
\underbrace{
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &... & -1 & ... & 0 & ... & -1 & ... & 1
\end{bmatrix}
}_G
\begin{bmatrix}
... \\
f_{l_z} \\
... \\
f_{r_z} \\
...
\end{bmatrix}
\leq
\underbrace{
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
}_h
$$

## In practice

In practice, you can consider using:

* Python: [qpsolvers](https://pypi.org/project/qpsolvers/)
* C++: [Eiquadprog](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/eiquadprog)

But there are many other implementations and libraries out there!

# More generally

Solving tasks-space problem with dynamics using QP solvers is extensively studied in robotics.

This is what is achieved in solvers like [TSID (Task-Space Inverse Dynamics)](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/tsid).
In such setup, you minimize a score function subject to equation $$(2)$$, using some solver like [Quadratic
Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_programming).

There are many advantages of doing so; since you can also add some inequality constraints, limiting the torque
and forces to feasible ranges.
